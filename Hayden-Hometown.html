		<h1>Caledonia <span>Ontario </span></h1>
		<h2>Haldimand County</h2>
		
		<p>Caledonia, Ontario is a small town located on the Grand River in Haldimand County. In 2016, the population was just under 10,000, however since then, there have been two major housing developments built, therefore my prediction would be between 15,000 to 20,000 now. <br>The river that flows through the town seperates the north and south side of the town and is connected via the historic bridge. </p>

		<p>The Caledonia Old Mill was a historic building in town which was built in 1846. <br>Unfortunately, the old mill had to be dismantled in 2018 due to structural issues but was rebuilt. During the holiday season, the town puts lights on it that dance to songs on the local radio station!</p>

		<p>Here are some more fun facts about Caledonia:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The Oasis Drive-In is a restaurant located in Caledonia, Ontario Canada. It opened in 1927 and is considered to be Ontario's and likely Canada's oldest Drive-In restaurant. </li>
			<li>Caledonia has a few notable residents, including Andrew Campbell, a former NHL hockey player who also happens to be my cousin!</li>
			<li>In 2006, the Grand River land dispute involving First Nation land claims brought Caledonia to national attention.</li>
